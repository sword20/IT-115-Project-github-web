    <p style="font-family:verdana;">Twitter launched in July 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams.

  <ul>

  <li style="font-family:verdana;"> Advantages </li>

  <p style="font-family:verdana;">Twitter allows you to be aware of everything that interests you, such as communities, celebrities or just people you know. It is a big platform for networking.

  Making the character cap at 140 makes the social network simple and practical for human thinking.

  It is also possible to combine your Twitter account with your Facebook account, saving time from posting on each social media platform.</p>

  <li style="font-family:verdana;"> Disadvantages </li>

  <p style="font-family:verdana;">False profiles on Twitter are very common and this generates distrust in the network.

  False profiles are also used to imitate people and celebrities and taking advantage of others.

  This also creates a lot of spam on the network that can not be controlled, making the netweork too fast in term of Tweets.<p/>

  <ul>

  <li style="font-family:verdana;">Advantages </li>

  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Youtube is not only free to use, but it allows content creators or anyone (in general) to have an opportunity to earn money from getting views on you're videos. Videos can go from music, animations, vlogs and anything that you're heart desires. Youtube also provides a feature where users can provide links to their social media's, contact, products, offer services etc in their profile bio or within their video description, where viewers can easily see and access by a click of a button. </p>

  <li style="font-family:verdana;">

    Disadvantages </li>

  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Youtube has many advantages for anyone to roll over and join at anytime, nevertheless, it has many downsides. One disadvantage is that once you upload a public video, it is public. Many big youtubers have posted a video and have received harmful comments and backlash on their content depending on if people find the video offensive or not. Everyone has their own opinion at the end of the day. Another thing about the platform is that theres many rules that content creators must follow. If they don't follow their guidelines, they can get their channel banned. Another problem is copyright, if you include a song even a second of it, your video can get taken down. Youtube can be very tricky when it comes to creating content or building off of other content creators. </p>
