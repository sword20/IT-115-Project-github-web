<h2 id="history"> History of Web Development </h2>

    <p>The history of the internet began withthe networking project in 1969. It's main purpose was to privately send data from governments and universities, it was not open to the public and programs were difficult to use. The first web browser was created in 1990 by a Computer Scientist named Tim Berners-Lee. It was the first graphical web browser compared to the TEXT-ONLY browsers. He called the browser window to the internet the “WorldWideWeb”. It was created for the NeXT computer.</p>
    <p> The internet popularity began to grow in 1993 when Governments, universities, and businesses saw an opportunity in the “Open Web". This is when Mosaic was released and was the first browser to include embedded images and was “the world’s first most popular browser".</p> 
    <p>In 1994, Netscapse Navigator improved the Mosaic browser and gave way to the “dot com boom”. The dot com boom started in 1995 continued to grow until 2000 when it peaked. During this time Microsoft released Internet Explorer. 
    In 1996 Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator began the "Browser Wars". Web browsers were paid for until Microsoft released IE 2.0 for free. After this, all companies started releasing their browsers for free. New developments were constantly added and contibue to grow to this day.

<h2 id="covid"> Effects of Covid </h2>

  <p>Prior to the emergence of Covid -19 most Web Development was done in a work environment. As the pandemic began, countless businesses closed resulting in a large number of job loss. Companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and many more transitioned to working from home and using digital tools such Zoom and Microsoft Teams for meetings. As other businesses in the struggled to make ends meet, one area that has seen a boost is web traffic and e-commerce. As a result of the surge of web traffic and e-commerce, countless tech companies are looking for Web Developers, User Interaction and User Experience Design to capitalize on this surge.</p>  
  <p>Social networks are a prime example of companies taking advantage of this surge. Before COVID-19 hit, Facebook was seeing a decline in growth rates. Once the pandemic started, Facebook began seeing a growth of 50% in Facebook use in countries affected by COVID-19. Andrew Rudister, an employee from a web development company called maxburst said that, “COVID-19 has bumped up internet use by a massive 70%, and this really cannot be ignored”. Experts in the development field are introducing innovations and are assisting businesses to make a strong online presence.</p>  
  <p>While some companies took advantage of the recent surges on internet use, other companies who wanted no part of creating a digital footprint, have no choice except to build a digital presence from scratch. An article from ProductionHub said, “before COVID-19, investing in a website was an afterthought for many businesses”. For these companies to stay in business, they have to meet where the consumers are.</p>


<h2 id="future">Future of Web Development</h2>

    <p>Artificial Inteligence is the future trend of web space development. It will play a bigger role within the next upcoming years. Covid has propeled the worlds reliance on virtual environments, whether it be learning, working or entertainment. All aspects of human life have found a way to interact with others without being in the same room. Leading corporate companies like Google and Microsoft have launched their AI technology for the public, anyone can build their custom websites with the power of AI.</p> 
    <p>One of the latest AI implementations is the grid. This allows web development to become a simpler process, and initiates content-based development. All people have to do is click a button, follow the instructions and go from there.</p>
